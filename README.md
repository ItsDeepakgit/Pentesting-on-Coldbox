# Pentesting-on-Coldbox
To assess the security of a ColdBox application and identify potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
# Penetration Testing Methodology
- Target Machine IP Address
- Network Scanning
- Enumeration and Identifying Vulnerabilities in WordPress
- Brute Forcing on WordPress Login
- Uploading a Reverse Shell
- Getting Root Privileges and Reading the Flag
## The target machine IP address by running the VM:
1) The first Step to identify the target machine IP address; since I was running the virtual machine in the same network, I can identify the target machine IP address by running the netdiscover command.
Command used:
`netdiscover –r 192.168.56.0/24`

In the above screenshot showing multiple IP address (i.e.: target IP: 192.168.56.102 & Attacker or Kali Machine IP: 192.168.56.100).

## Network Scanning
2) After getting the target machine IP address, the next step is to find out the open ports and services available on the machine.
Command used:
`nmap -Pn 192.168.56.0/24`

For more information I was using whatweb command:

--> Service: http | Version: Apache 2.4.18 | HttpServer: Ubuntu Linux

## Enumeration and Identifying Vulnerabilities in WordPress
3) From this point I identifies port 80 is opened then it works with the browser. And I enter the target IP into the Mozilla browser.

The bottom of this has a login link. Now I click that and broswer to that link. Then I identify a standard WordPress page.

4) So now, I used Wpscan tool to find out the usernames and passwords. 
Command Used: `wpscan --url http://192.168.56.102 --enumerate u` 

![5](https://github.com/ItsDeepakgit/Pentesting-on-Coldbox/assets/91217911/dae2c2a6-4f80-41d6-a766-7072f6385e55)

From this, I found there are serveral user names.

## Brute Forcing on WordPress Login
5) Here, I choose the c0ldd username and I perform a brute force attack using wpscan to find the password.
Command Used: `wpscan --url http://192.168.56.102 --usernames c0ldd --passwords /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

From this, I found that password: 9876543210

6) Now, I used this username and password to log into the WordPress admin dashborad.

![8](https://github.com/ItsDeepakgit/Pentesting-on-Coldbox/assets/91217911/83e0b122-6ea7-48ce-ad5d-f0b8c41d7f6d)

Now I’m in the admin dashboard. WordPress just like any other content management system always has a way to execute code so long as I was authenticated. In my case edit a 404.php template and use it to get a shell on the box. 

![9](https://github.com/ItsDeepakgit/Pentesting-on-Coldbox/assets/91217911/b2e60efe-9541-4127-8ae0-6de1b6e24a34)

## Uploading a Reverse Shell
7) Navigating to appearance -> editor
8) I can add a reverse shell by modifying the 404.php.

![10](https://github.com/ItsDeepakgit/Pentesting-on-Coldbox/assets/91217911/77cf0575-a4ba-4993-b22d-7ab516a5807c)

9)  In this reverse-shell, I have to change my IP and port.

![11](https://github.com/ItsDeepakgit/Pentesting-on-Coldbox/assets/91217911/cd2d752a-78d4-48c3-83a5-5b50ac89c4a7)

10) Next, I set up a netcat listener on the box. Re-browsing targeted IP address on the browser. Now, I opened the python spawned shell.

![12](https://github.com/ItsDeepakgit/Pentesting-on-Coldbox/assets/91217911/a3a6e172-495c-4230-8c0b-98e2dbf8b452)

In the above screenshot, showing the important **wp-config.php** file because it contains the user name and password for the database.

11) Then I used more command to see the file username and password.

![13](https://github.com/ItsDeepakgit/Pentesting-on-Coldbox/assets/91217911/49e3c11e-166f-4042-a212-3647167189eb)

From this, I can obtain the credentials.

12) Now I used credentials to log into that account.

![14](https://github.com/ItsDeepakgit/Pentesting-on-Coldbox/assets/91217911/2c2d2c78-5ed0-492b-8c46-9bb02ea77a0a)

13) Next I perform the ls command to know what the files in there are. Then I find a file called user.txt. Now I use cat command to see the content of the file. Then decode this text.

![16](https://github.com/ItsDeepakgit/Pentesting-on-Coldbox/assets/91217911/f4772586-34c6-48e9-bff5-f46c14bdec8c)

I found the first flag from that file: **Congratulations, first level achieved!** 

![17](https://github.com/ItsDeepakgit/Pentesting-on-Coldbox/assets/91217911/2cd71271-fc51-425b-91e6-877fe6d4433f)

## Getting Root Privileges and Reading the Flag

14) I perform sudo –l command to list binary files of root.

![15](https://github.com/ItsDeepakgit/Pentesting-on-Coldbox/assets/91217911/cf59ad18-6d02-46c4-822d-ec4b7ac9439f)

Next, I used vim to get a root shell. In this below screenshot root flag was found in the root directory as named as ‘root.txt’. It has base64 encoded text. Then I used my kali box to decode this text.

![18](https://github.com/ItsDeepakgit/Pentesting-on-Coldbox/assets/91217911/1f393a5b-8540-4039-804b-46387e6c6bda)

Finally, I found the root flag from that file: **Congratulations, machine completed!#**
